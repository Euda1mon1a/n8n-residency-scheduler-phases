# n8n Residency Scheduler Phases  

## Overview  
This repository contains refactored scheduler phases for the medical residency scheduling system using the n8n automation platform. It houses exported workflow JSON files that define each phase of the scheduling logic.  

## Contents  
- **Medical Residency Scheduler â€“ Phase 0 + 1**: Initial phases of the scheduling workflow, handling foundational data loading and early scheduling logic.  
- *Future phases*: Additional phases will be added as the scheduler evolves to handle more complex scheduling requirements.

1. Download the desired JSON file from this repository.  
2. In n8n, create a new workflow or open an existing one.  
3. Use the three-dot menu next to the workflow name and select **Import from File**.  
4. Choose the downloaded JSON file to import the workflow.
